# FirstTest
This was a webscraper personally crafted for use on Mturk.

This code was made when I was relatively new at programming.  It is not designed with solid coding principles.  It is designed only to perform the function it was given
Which is:

Code used to pick up hits on Amazon mturk
Use with pandacrazy to keep track of hits obtained
Plug code straight into console

There might be memory issues, just reopen the browser to reset the code.
Code might deactivate randomly, just initiate it again.
Also must manually maintain blacklist.
